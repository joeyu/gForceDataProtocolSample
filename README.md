## Brief
This source code is to illustrate how to get the data of gForce armband in
an Android phone through the Android GATT service.

The supported version of gForce armband data protocol is v1.0. Please also
refer to the document of `gForce Data Protocol`.

**Note**:
> The supported Android SDK version is Android 4.3 (API level 18) and higher.
> You need an Android phone with these versions as well.

## Build and run
1. Open this project in Android Studio, and then build, install and run the demo
on your phone with supported Android version.

2. Scan and select the gForce armband to connect. As long as the connection
   succeeds, you will be able to see the data (e.g. quaterions and gestures)
   displayed.
